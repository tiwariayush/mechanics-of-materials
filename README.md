# mechanics-of-materials

About
=====
This module is built to demonstrate the basic matrix algebra, as well as its usage in Mechanics of Materials.
It was developed for demonstration as a Practical #5 under the course MI-364 taken by Dr.Manish Joglekar

Major functions are :- 
- Matrix multiplication (Basic looping as well as using numpy built-in functions)
- Coordinate transformation
- Displacement Gradient for a given displacement field
- Rotation tensor
- Strain tensor

Dependencies
===========

- Numpy, install using `sudo pip install numpy`
- Sympy, install by `sudo pip install sympy`

Contribution
===========

Though the project is very basic at first, but you are welcome to contribute to develop it further.
Send pull request with any addition or debugging.
Thank You

Future additions should be following :-
- Strain Transformation
- Principal Strains
- Stress tensor
- Stress transformation
- Principal stresses
